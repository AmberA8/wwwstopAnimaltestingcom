  <h3 style="color:white;" Misconceptions. </h3>
<p> Unfortunately there has been plenty of misconceptions about animal testing. Usually, when people hear the word animal testing from brands they believe that the brand is trying out their products on animals. For example, if a toothpaste brand isn't cruelty-free, many will dismiss this. This is because they think that they are just putting on the toothpaste and brushing the animal's teeth. This still has no consent, however, this is nothing compared to actual animal testing.  </p>

  <h3 style="color:white;" So what exactly is animal testing? </h3>
  <p> Animal testing is when animals are forced to go through terrible conditions and treatment. Animals are forced to be exposed to toxic chemicals, drugs, illness, physically restrained, deprived of food and water, and other torturous methods. Some animals even have to be cut open. Back to the example I used, the toothpaste companies will add a tooth infection or disease and observe if the toothpaste will help. Thus forcing the animal to go through pain because of the disease. And also ruining the animal's teeth. Then the animals are killed when it's over. This is the truth behind animal testing, the pain, and cruelty that animals have to face. Companies don't care for the suffering animals as long as their pockets are still being filled. </p>
