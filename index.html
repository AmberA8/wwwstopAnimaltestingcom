  <p style="font-size: 24px; color:white"> Animal testing has been around for <br> many years. Tons of brands use it and <br> many customers brush it off worldwide. <br>According to the human society of the <br> US, it states "Each year, it is estimated <br> that more than 50 million dogs, cats, <br> monkeys, rabbits, rats and other <br>animals are forced to endure painful <br> experiments in the U.S." These animals are <br> treated terribly just for the sake of the <br> experiment and then killed when it's over.   </p>
